This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
df <- read.csv(file='strategies/training_data.csv')
head(df)
```


Complete the following actions:
1) Convert position_type column to 1s and 0s
2) Convert outcome column from string to boolean
3) Drop previous index and timestamp columns 

```{r}
df$position_type <- as.integer(as.logical(df$position_type=="long"))
df$outcome <- as.logical(df$outcome=="True")
df = subset(df, select = -c(X,timestamp) )
head(df)
```
